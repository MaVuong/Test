Hello, Google manager
I know two apps: Monkey Junior  and Monkey Stories via Facebook ads. I installed these two apps and wanted to buy in-app these apps. However, the payment function of these two apps required me to transfer directly to a bank account of a company in Vietnam. My question is if I follow their request, will I get google refund guarantee when a problem occurs? Does this payment method ensure my safety when they do not use "Google Play's payment system"? I have read the terms of Google and I think you are being overpaid by these apps by checking the IP address, if they are Vietnamese they will ask for cash payment and no form of payment through Google Payment. Please check this app using VPN(fake ip) to have IP in Vietnam and you need to have a tester who knows Vietnamese.
Note that there must be an IP address in Vietnam and the tester is also Vietnamese (or know how to speak Vietnamese)
IP Vietnam will not have paid Google:
